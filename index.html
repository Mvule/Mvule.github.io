        <p>The mvule tree is very precious to the growing economy of Uganda. It is an endangered species of tree also known as Intule, African Teak, Kambala and Iroko.
            Each Mvule tree cut down in a village is used to get income to build schools and wells in the village.
            </p>
        
        <div><h1>Fun Facts</h1><hr> 
        <p>The mvule tree can grow up to 50 metres highs.
            Fun fact-Until the British colonialists arrived with saws, the technology in Uganda as not powerful enough to cut through the hard wood of a thick Mvule trunk. Now the beautiful wood is in such high demand that mature mvule trees are rare
            
            In 2018 The Mvule program provided 150 Mvule saplings to the Bukudumira village in Busoga. They showed them how to grow them and care for them. The Ugandan government strictly regulates mvule timber, since mature mvule tress are so rare. The Mvule saplings that Bukudumira planted are an investment in their children’s and grandchildren’s future.
